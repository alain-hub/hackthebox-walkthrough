#hi everyone, welcome to axile walkthrough from hackthebox

MACHINE NAME: AXILE
DIFFICULTY:HARD

-> nmap scan: nmap -sV -sC -A -T5 $ip

result:
![nmap scan](<nmap scan-1.png>)


after performing so many tries to get have access to the machine, we still aren't able.

after sometime of research, i found that inorder to have a remote session to the machine we would use a script.
